Hardware:
    1. relay hole size
    2. Power jack hole size
    3. power jack parallel w/ rj45
    4. j1 roation/label
    5. label size
    6. move electrolytic caps
    7. label raw,gnd,3v3
    8. R2 (bias R) should be 2K
    9. twisted pair pins are reversed
   10. magjack pin 3 needs to go to 3.3v via ferrite
   11. LEDs on each relay
   12. bias resistor on relay transistor?
